@*to create a strongly typed view, we use the @model object*@

@*we can now use only the model name as the namespace has been specified in viewimports*@
@model Employee;


@{
    //Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"; this line is no longer required due to the viewstart file
    ViewBag.Title = "Employee Details";
}


@*when returning string value from viewdata, we do not have to explicitly 
    cast the output to string. However for returning any other data type,
    there has to be explicit casting
*@

@*using viewdata has the limitation of creating a loosly typed view
    such that the view does not know the type of the keys that are being passed
    at compile time. It only knows that at run time. There's also no intellicence
    so we can misspell anything and not notice until runtime
*@

@*viewdata is dynamically resolved at runtime so it does not provide compile
    time type checking, thus there is no intellicense
